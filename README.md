I'm using the H2 database, so to access the data, you must run the code and then write the link below in your browser: 
<br>
http://localhost:8080/h2-console
<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm also using Postman to test "PUT" and "GET" methods.
<br>
<br>
<br>
If you have any doubt about Postman and H2 Database or how to test the code, you can acces the link below and watch the video:
